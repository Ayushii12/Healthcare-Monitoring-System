# Hospital Management System
## Overview

This project implements a **Hospital Management System** that provides functionality for patients, doctors, and hospital staff to efficiently manage appointments, medical records, and patient care. It is designed to ensure secure access, track appointments, and facilitate communication between patients and healthcare providers. The system has role-based access for different user types, including patients, doctors, staff members, and administrative authorities.

## Features

### 1. **Patient Management**
- Patients can view charts and diagrams related to their health parameters.
- The system provides quick suggestions based on changes in these parameters.
- Patients can track and receive notifications about upcoming appointments, with reminders sent one day in advance.
- Secure login using a personal **Login ID** and **password**.
  
### 2. **Doctor Management**
- Doctors can view and access their daily appointments through system notifications.
- Doctors have the ability to view the medical records of their patients and update them in case of new medical conditions.
  
### 3. **Staff Management**
- Hospital staff can access all patient data within the hospital (unlike individual patients who can only view their own data).
- Staff members can accept or reject patient requests for admission into the hospital.

### 4. **Administrative Authorities**
The system includes two levels of administrative authority to maintain and manage the hospital records:

- **Website Administrator**:
  - Can add or remove hospital administrators.
  
- **Hospital Administrator**:
  - Can add or remove doctors and staff members for a specific hospital.

### 5. **Security and Data Integrity**
- Every user must log in using a unique **Login ID** and **password** to maintain system security.
- In the event of a system crash, data integrity is maintained, ensuring no loss of information.
